Machine Learning is undeniably one of the most influential( and powerful) technologies in tod(ay’s world. More importan(tly, we are far (from seeingi(t[s full potential. There’s n]o doubt, it will c{ontinue to be making headline}s for the foresee{able future. This article is des}igned as an introduction to the{ Machine Learning} concepts, cove8ri2ng 8a1l1l56 6t2h8e fundamental ideas without being too high level.Machine learning is a tool for turning information into knowledge. In the past 50 years, there has been an explosion of data. This mass of data is useless unless we analyse it and find the patterns hidden within. Machine learning techniques are used to automatically find the valuable underlying patterns within complex data that we would otherwise struggle to discover. The hidden patterns andknowledge about a problem can be used to predict future events and perform all kinds of complex decision making.all credits to : gavin edwards towards data science
